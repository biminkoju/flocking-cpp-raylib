# flocking implementation

shitty implementation of flocking algorithim in c++ using raylib

i included the raylib files as well so to build the project there is a make file in the build folder
just run i dont know

you can tweak the allign, cohesion and seperation values in the boid.cpp which is in the src folder.

the boid struct contains the said variables and there is a flock size macro at the top of the file

idk have fun
